This is a Dummy Website For You to get Your First PR !~
Its Only For Practice and Not Accepted for Hacktoberfest

--------------------------------------------
Let's Help You Get Your First PR
There are 2 Ways to do this

Option 1. Complete this process in Github (in your browser)

Fork the project:
Click the gray Fork button in the top right of this page. This creates your copy of the project and saves it as a new repository in your github account
Create a New Branch:
On your new repository's page, click the gray main button in the upper left to reveal a dropdown menu.
Enter the name of your new branch in the text box. (Branch names usually make a reference to what is being changed. Example: nameAdd).
Click on Create branch <new branch name> and this will automatically take you to your new branch. You can make edits on the main branch, but this may cause issues down the line. Best practice is to create a new branch for each separate issue you work on. That way your main branch remains in sync with Eddie's main branch.
Edit:
On the top right of the Readme file, click on the pencil icon to edit the file by adding your name.
After editing the Readme file, add a commit message and click on the green button saying "Commit Changes". Make sure you have selected the branch you have created.
Raise a Pull Request:
Click Pull Requests (which is the third option at the top of this page after the options Code and Issues).
Click the green New Pull Request button. This will prep the new pull request for you by autofilling the base repository: base with 'EddieGitHubCommunity: main' AND autofilling your head repository: compare with your repository: main
Click on your head repository's compare dropdown, and switch branches from your 'main' branch to <new branch name>.
Finally, click the green Create Pull Request button. Great job! You did it!
You can ask questions by raising an issue.

Option 2. Complete this process on your computer (locally)
Fork the project: Click the gray Fork button in the top right of this page. This creates your copy of the project and saves it as a new repository in your github account

Click on the green Code button, then either the HTTPS or SSH option and, click the icon to copy the URL. Now you have a copy of the project. Thus, you can play around with it locally on your computer.

Run the following commands into a terminal window (Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, Bash, ZSH). Do this to download the forked copy of this repository to your computer.

  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/StateYourName.git
Switch to the cloned folder. You can paste this command into the same terminal window.
  cd hacktoberfest-practice
Make a new branch. Your username would make a good branch because it's unique.
  git checkout -b <name-of-new-branch>
Open the README.md file

Add your name to the section that matches your Initial in this list, make sure that your name is in alphabetical order. Then save your changes.

For example - [Full Name](https://github.com/your-username)

Stage your changes.

  git add README.md
or

  git add .
Commit the changes.
  git commit -m "Add <your-github-username>"
Check the status of your repository.
  git status
The response should be like this:
On branch <name-of-your-branch>
nothing to commit, working tree clean
Pushing your repository to GitHub.
  git push origin <name-of-your-branch>
or

  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
Warning: If you get an error message like the one below, you probably forgot to fork the repository before cloning it. It is best to start over and fork the project repository first.

ERROR: Permission to EddieHubCommunity/hacktoberfest-practice.git denied to <your-github-username>.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
On the GitHub website, navigate to your forked repo - on the top of the files section, you'll notice a new section containing a Compare & Pull Request button!

Click on that button, this will load a new page, comparing the local branch in your forked repository against the main branch in the EddieHub Hacktoberfest repository. Accept the default values in the dropdown boxes and click the green Create Pull Request button. After creating the PR (Pull Request), our GitHub Actions workflow will add a welcome message to your PR. Note: A pull request allows us to merge your changes with the original project repo.

Your pull request will be reviewed and then eventually merged.

Hurray! You successfully have made your first contribution! ðŸŽ‰

How can I fix a merge conflict?
A GitHub conflict is when people make changes to the same area or line in a file. This must be fixed before it is merged in order to prevent collision in the main branch.

To read more about this, go to GitHub Docs - About Merge Conflicts

You can also ask for help in our Discord server or submit an issue in the Support repository.
